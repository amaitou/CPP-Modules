# CPP Modules

In this series of projects 42 attempts to give us a deep understanding of C++ especially concepts related to `Object-Oriented Programming` and it made us go all through the `OOP` concepts to understand them by doing a lot of projects (tricky ones) in order to get the whole picture of `OOP`.

# Useful Links to get into CPP'OOP

here's a curated list of useful links for learning various Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++:

- [C++ Classes and Objects](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-classes-and-objects/)
	- This tutorial explains the basics of classes and objects in C++, covering topics like class definition, object creation, member functions, and data members.
	---
- [Polymorphism and Virtual Functions](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_polymorphism.htm)
	-  Understand polymorphism and virtual functions in C++. Learn how to achieve runtime polymorphism through the use of virtual functions.
	---
- [Abstract Classes and Pure Virtual Functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pure-virtual-functions-and-abstract-classes/)
	- Learn about abstract classes and pure virtual functions, which are fundamental concepts for creating interfaces and achieving abstraction in C++.
	---
- [Inheritance in C++](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/111-introduction-to-inheritance/)
	- This tutorial provides an introduction to inheritance in C++, explaining how to create derived classes, base classes, and how inheritance hierarchy works.
	---
- [The Diamond Problem and Virtual Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multiple-inheritance-in-c/)
	- Understand the diamond problem in multiple inheritance and how virtual inheritance helps solve the ambiguity it creates.
	---
- [C++ Fixed-Point Arithmetic](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2018/07/12/simple-fixed-point-conversion-in-c/)
	-  Learn about fixed-point arithmetic in C++, which is useful for applications where floating-point arithmetic is less suitable due to resource constraints.
	---

>> These resources cover a wide range of OOP concepts in C++, including classes, polymorphism, abstract classes, virtual functions, inheritance, the diamond problem, and even fixed-point arithmetic. Remember to practice hands-on coding and experiment with these concepts to solidify your understanding.
