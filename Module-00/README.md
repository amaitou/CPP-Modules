# C++ Class

In C++, a class is a blueprint or a user-defined data type that defines a structure to represent objects and their associated behavior. It encapsulates both data (attributes) and functions (methods) that operate on the data. You can think of a class as a template for creating objects

```c++
// Define a class named 'Person'
class Person {
public:
    // Attributes
    std::string name;
    int age;

    // Member functions (methods)
    void introduce() {
        std::cout << "Hi, I am " << name << " and I am " << age << " years old." << std::endl;
    }
};
```
In this example, the Person class has two attributes: name and age, and a member function introduce that allows a Person object to introduce itself.

# Member Function

A member function in C++ is a function that is associated with a class or an object of that class. It is a method that operates on the attributes or data members of the class. Member functions define the behavior of the class and allow you to perform operations or manipulate the data within the class. In the example above, introduce is a member function of the Person class, as it operates on the name and age attributes of the Person objects.

---

# Attribute Member in C++

An "attribute member" in C++ typically refers to a data member or member variable of a class. These attributes store the data associated with the objects of the class. In the Person class example, name and age are attribute members because they hold data specific to each Person object.

---

# Using namespace std

using namespace std is a directive used in C++ to simplify the use of standard library elements without needing to specify the std:: prefix. In C++, many standard functions, objects, and classes are part of the std namespace. When you use using namespace std, it tells the compiler to look for names in the std namespace by default, which can make your code shorter and easier to read

```c++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    using namespace std;  // This line

    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;  // No need to use std::cout
    return 0;
}
```

However, it's important to note that while using namespace std can make your code more concise, it can also lead to naming conflicts and is generally discouraged in larger, more complex programs. It's better practice to use the std:: prefix when needed to avoid potential issues.

# Name Conflicts

"Name conflicts" in C++ occur when there are multiple definitions for the same name (e.g., a function or variable) in different namespaces or contexts, making it ambiguous for the compiler to determine which one to use. Using using namespace can potentially introduce name conflicts, especially when you have custom names that clash with standard library names or names from other libraries. Here are examples illustrating name conflicts when using namespace:

- Name Conflict with Standard Library
	```c++
		#include <iostream>
		// Custom max function
		int max(int a, int b)
		{
			return a > b ? a : b;
		}

		using namespace std; // Using the std namespace

		int main()
		{
			int x = 5, y = 7;
			cout << max(x, y) << endl; // Which 'max' function to use?
			return 0;
		}
		```
	In this case, there's a name conflict between your custom max function and the std::max function from the standard library. The compiler won't be able to resolve this conflict, and you'll get an error.

	---

- Name Conflict with Other Libraries

	```c++
	#include <iostream>

	// Custom Window class
	class Window {
	public:
		void open()
		{
			std::cout << "Custom Window opened." << std::endl;
		}
	};

	// Simulated external graphics library with its own Window class
	namespace GraphicsLibrary
	{
		class Window {
		public:
			void open() {
				std::cout << "Graphics Library Window opened." << std::endl;
			}
		}
	}

	using namespace GraphicsLibrary; // Using the graphics library's namespace

	int main()
	{
		Window myWindow;
		myWindow.open(); // Which 'Window' class to use?

		return 0;
	}
	```

	In this example, the custom Window class and the Window class from the graphics library both have an open method. When you use using namespace GraphicsLibrary, there's a name conflict, and it's unclear which Window class's open method should be called.

	To avoid name conflicts, you can use more explicit approaches such as specifying the full namespace (e.g., std::cout instead of cout) or selectively using only the elements you need from a namespace (e.g., using std::cout instead of using namespace std). This way, you can maintain control over which names are brought into the current scope and reduce the risk of conflicts.

# Static Members

static members are class members (variables or functions) that are associated with the class itself, rather than with instances or objects of the class. These members are shared among all instances of the class, and they can be accessed using the class name without the need to create an object. Static members have several important characteristics:

- *Shared Among All Objects* -> Static members are shared by all instances (objects) of the class. They are not unique to any specific object; they belong to the class itself.

- *Accessed via Class Name* -> You can access static members using the class name followed by the scope resolution operator ::, without creating an instance of the class.

- *Exist Even Without Instances* -> Static members exist even if there are no instances of the class created. They are associated with the class definition, not with instances.

- *Can't Access Non-Static Members* -> Static members cannot access non-static (instance) members of the class directly because they don't have access to a specific instance's data. However, non-static members can access static members.

```c++
class MyClass
{
	public:
		static int staticData; // Static data member

		MyClass(int value)
		{
			instanceData = value;
			staticData++; // Accessing the static member in the constructor
		}

		int getInstanceData()
		{
			return instanceData;
		}

		static int getStaticData()
		{
			return staticData; // Accessing the static member in a static member function
		}

	private:
		int instanceData;
};

int MyClass::staticData = 0; // Definition and initialization of the static data member

int main()
{
    MyClass obj1(42);
    MyClass obj2(57);

    // Accessing the static member using the class name
    std::cout << "Static data: " << MyClass::staticData << std::endl;

    // Accessing the instance data
    std::cout << "Instance data (obj1): " << obj1.getInstanceData() << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Instance data (obj2): " << obj2.getInstanceData() << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```
